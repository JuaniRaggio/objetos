## Method overloading
---
We can unify methods declareing them with the same name but different parameter types
For example:
```java
public class ArraySearch2 {
    public static boolean searchArray(String target, String[] array) {
        boolean result = false;
        for (String element : array) {
            if ((element != null) && (element.equals(target))) {
                result = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
        
    public static boolean searchArray(int target, int[] array) {
        boolean result = false;
        for (int element : array) {
            if (element == target) {
                result = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }

```
- *Both searchArray()* are methods inside the ArraySearch2 class but they have diferent types of arguments. Even they have the same name, java allows this and depending on the type of parameters the method recieves, the method used will be the first one or the second one
- Also in two overloaded methods *the amount of parameters* can change. The condition for being able to define overloaded methods is to have changes on parameters, so that the compiler knows which one you are trying to use

"At compile time, when Java sees a call to an overloaded method like searchArray, it examines the actual parameter list and searches for a method with a matching signature. If there is one, then the generated bytecode binds that call to the definition of that matching version. So, at runtime, the JVM already knows which version of an overloaded method it will execute."

#### Error cases
---
If we pass invalid parameters, the compiler will return some errors.
For example:

```java
ArraySearch2.searchArray(90.0, weekHighs);
```

- 90.0 is double so the compiler won't find a suitable method, since it will be looking for a method with the following signature:

```java
searchArray(double,int[]);
```


### Overloaded known methods
---
*println()* is an overloaded method
```java
System.out.println("90"); //calls println(String)
System.out.println(90); //calls println(int)
System.out.println(90L); //calls println(long)
System.out.println(90.0F); //calls println(float)
System.out.println(90.0); //calls println(double)
System.out.println('9'); //calls println(char)
System.out.println(true); //calls println(boolean)
```


## NOT overloaded methods
---
If the changes to the method are in the return value, then the compiler will throw an error of redefinition since it can't define which one to use
```java
boolean searchArray(double, int[]);
String searchArray(double, int[]);
```
The compiler won't be able to define which one to use
